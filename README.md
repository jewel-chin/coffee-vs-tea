# Data Visualisation

## Context

For my Data Visualization module, I was tasked with presenting our findings based on any datasets of my choice, in the form of a recorded video that explains my visualizations through a slide presentation. In this project, I was required to apply design principles that I had learned throughout the course.

I decided to take this a step further by creating a scrollytelling website to present my findings in a more immersive and interactive way. This approach was inspired by the works of the Digital Graphics team at The Straits Times.

## Selected Datasets
1. [Coffee ICO dataset. Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/coffee-dataset)
2. [Tea FAO dataset. Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/tea-fao-dataset)
3. [Resource trade data](https://resourcetrade.earth/)

All datasets were preprocessed, cleaned, and visualized using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebooks to better understand the data. Please note that my notebooks are currently not accessible.

## Tech stack

- Website developed using **React** and **JavaScript**.
- Visualizations created with **D3.js, Matplotlib, and Plotly**.
  - Visualization types include choropleths, stacked bar charts, line graphs, network graphs, and Sankey diagrams.

This website is deployed at: https://jewel-chin.github.io/coffee-vs-tea/. Please note that the site is not currently responsive, so it is recommended to view it on desktop for the best experience.
