# Data Visualisation: Coffee vs Tea

## Context

For my Data Visualization module, I was tasked with presenting our findings based on any datasets of my choice, in the form of a recorded video that explains my visualizations through a slide presentation. In this project, I was required to apply design principles and create visualisations that I had learned throughout the course.

I decided to take this a step further by creating a scrollytelling website to present my findings in a more immersive and interactive way. This approach was inspired by the works of the Digital Graphics team at The Straits Times.

## Project Objectives

The timeless question "Coffee or Tea?" encourages consumers like us to share our preferences, but what does it mean when we consider these beverages as commodities instead of just drinks? This inquiry encompasses not only our individual choices but also the cultural identities, economic structures, and global trade dynamics that shape these products. As a fan of both beverages, I find the broader implications of this question on a global scale fascinating. This project explores the intricate relationships between coffee and tea, emphasizing on their production and trade flows.

## Tech stack

- Website developed using **React** and **JavaScript**.
- Visualizations created with **D3.js, Matplotlib, and Plotly**.
  - Visualization types include choropleths, stacked bar charts, line graphs, network graphs, and Sankey diagrams.

## Selected Datasets
1. [Coffee ICO dataset. Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/coffee-dataset)
2. [Tea FAO dataset. Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/tea-fao-dataset)
3. [Resource trade data](https://resourcetrade.earth/)

All datasets were preprocessed, cleaned, and visualized using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebooks to better understand the data. Please note that my notebooks are currently not accessible.
